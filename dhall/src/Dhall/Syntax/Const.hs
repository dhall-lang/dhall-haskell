    The axioms are:

> ⊦ Type : Kind
> ⊦ Kind : Sort

    ... and the valid rule pairs are:

> ⊦ Type ↝ Type : Type  -- Functions from terms to terms (ordinary functions)
> ⊦ Kind ↝ Type : Type  -- Functions from types to terms (type-polymorphic functions)
> ⊦ Sort ↝ Type : Type  -- Functions from kinds to terms
> ⊦ Kind ↝ Kind : Kind  -- Functions from types to types (type-level functions)
> ⊦ Sort ↝ Kind : Sort  -- Functions from kinds to types (kind-polymorphic functions)
> ⊦ Sort ↝ Sort : Sort  -- Functions from kinds to kinds (kind-level functions)

    Note that Dhall does not support functions from terms to types and therefore
    Dhall is not a dependently typed language
